        <h4>Little History About Me</h4>


        <P>I was born in Pleebo, Maryland County, Liberia on November 4, 1997. I was born unto the union of <strong>Mr. & Mrs. Tanneh-Bartee Seneh.</strong> I satrted schooling at the CRC school in Maryland County and i continued my elementary education at The Liberia Dujar High School located in the Grassfield Community, Gardnersville.
        I enrolled at the Liberia Dujar High School in the year 2004 while i was in the grade 1 anf i remained at the institution until i graduated from high school on August 21, 2016. I'm a person that really had the dream of becoming an excellent sofrware engineer since i graduated from high school.</P>


        <h4>Experience since joining K.I.T</h4>
        

        <P>It's normally very difficult to find any institution in my country that teaches intensely and is very strict when it comes to their rules and regulations in order to make sure that their students become the best out there.
            <strong>Kwagei Innovators Training (K.T.T)</strong> is undoubtedly one of those schools and it teaches what i've always wanted to learn.
        </P>I came across the K.I.T through a social media advertistment and decided to enroll into the institution.
        Since i enrolled at the K.I.T, my dreams are slowly comimg through, i can now create a webpage, an about me page, a calender. And as time goes by, i believe i'll be able to do so many other creative things because i know that K.I.T is the best.
